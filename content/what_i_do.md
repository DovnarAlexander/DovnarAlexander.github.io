# What I Do

- Design secure, scalable AWS architectures with clear cost controls
- Build CI/CD that shortens lead time and increases release safety
- Create Kubernetes platforms with GitOps, observability, and sane defaults
- Standardize Terraform/Terragrunt modules for reusable, compliant infra
- Implement actionable monitoring (SLIs/SLOs), logging, tracing
- Lead by doing: hands-on delivery, mentoring, and enablement
